                    <h4>My background & interest.</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have spent the last 10 years of my life welding and 5 of those years traveling the U.S. while welding.
                        I was lucky enough to have a job that gave me the means and opportunity to travel for many years of my life. 
                        Now as you can tell I am enrolled at OTC for my CIS degree. Which I hope will help me find a career in programming 
                        or preferably building costume power house computers. When Iâ€™m not hanging out with my wife I enjoy spending my 
                        free time tearing electronics apart and tinkering. I'm also a big-time gamer (PC and PlayStation) and will get lost 
                        in them for hours. A few games I enjoy are Call Of Duty (not counting Advanced Warfare or Infinite Warfare), Modern 
                        Warfare, PUBG, Overwatch and Destiny. On September 6th, be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/beardedgamerrr">Twitch page at BeardeDGameRrr</a> 
                        for all the new upcoming Destiny 2 information and walkthrough tutorials. Im also a BIG time Kansas City Chiefs fan.
